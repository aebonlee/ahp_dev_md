}
```

### Findings
- ✅ `DjangoProjectResponse` interface correctly matches backend structure
- ✅ All expected core fields are present
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** `member_count` field missing from actual API response
- ⚠️ **MINOR:** `objective` field missing from actual API response

---

## 2. Data Normalization Testing

### Test Methodology
- Simulated normalization functions with real and mock data
- Field mapping verification
- Edge case testing

### Results ✅ PASSED

#### Field Mappings Verified
| Django Field | Frontend Field | Status | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| `deadline` | `dueDate` | ✅ Working | Bidirectional mapping |
| `member_count` | `evaluatorCount` | ⚠️ Issue | Source field missing from API |
| `status` | `status` | ✅ Working | With normalization logic |

#### Status Normalization
- `evaluation` → `active` ✅
- `archived` → `completed` ✅
- Other statuses preserved ✅

#### Calculated Fields
- **Completion Rate:** Logic working correctly ✅
  - No setup: 0%
  - Basic setup only: 30%
  - With evaluators (draft): 30%
  - With evaluators (evaluation): 70%
  - Completed: 100%

- **Owner Email:** Generation working ✅
  - `"Test Admin"` → `"test.admin@ahp-platform.com"`
  - `null` → `""` (empty string)

## 3. Frontend Integration Analysis

### Test Methodology
- Component code analysis
- Field usage verification across components

### Results ⚠️ PARTIAL

#### Components Using Normalized Fields
- `EnhancedProjectDashboard.tsx` ✅
- `EvaluatorDashboard.tsx` ✅
- Several result analysis components ✅

#### Components NOT Using Normalized Fields
- `PersonalServiceDashboard.tsx` ❌
- `MyProjects.tsx` ❌
- Several admin components ❌

### Recommendations
1. Update remaining components to use normalized field names
2. Standardize field usage across all components
3. Add TypeScript strict checking for field consistency

## 4. API Layer Functionality Testing

### Test Methodology
- Bidirectional conversion simulation
- CRUD operation data flow testing

### Results ✅ PASSED

#### Create Operation Test
```javascript
// Frontend Input
{
  title: "새로운 AHP 프로젝트",
  dueDate: "2025-10-31T23:59:59.000Z",
  evaluatorCount: 5,
  completionRate: 75
}

// Django Payload (calculated fields excluded)
{
  title: "새로운 AHP 프로젝트", 
  deadline: "2025-10-31T23:59:59.000Z"
}

// Normalized Response
{
  title: "새로운 AHP 프로젝트",
  dueDate: "2025-10-31T23:59:59.000Z",
  evaluatorCount: 0, // Calculated from member_count
  completionRate: 0  // Calculated from project state
}
```

#### Data Preservation Analysis
All core fields preserved through conversion cycle:
- ✅ title, description, objective
- ✅ status, evaluation_mode, workflow_stage  
- ✅ dueDate ↔ deadline mapping
- ✅ Calculated fields properly generated

---

## 5. Data Consistency Verification

### Test Methodology
- Edge case testing with null/undefined values
- Default value verification
- Error handling testing

### Results ✅ PASSED

#### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ `null` owner → empty `ownerEmail`
- ✅ Missing `member_count` → `evaluatorCount: 0`
- ✅ Unknown status → preserved as-is
- ✅ `null` dates → preserved as `null`
- ✅ Missing count fields → handled gracefully

#### Default Values Working
- ✅ `evaluatorCount: 0` when `member_count` missing
- ✅ `completionRate: 0` when no criteria/alternatives
- ✅ `ownerEmail: ""` when owner is null

## Critical Issues Identified

### 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Missing member_count Field**

**Problem:** The actual Django API at `/api/service/projects/projects/` does not return the `member_count` field.

**Impact:**
- `evaluatorCount` will always be 0
- `completionRate` calculation will be inaccurate
- Dashboard statistics will be incorrect

**Evidence:**
```json
// Expected in Django response
"member_count": 5

// Actually missing from real API response
```

**Solution:** Update Django backend to include `member_count` in project serializer.

### ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUE #1: Missing objective Field**

**Problem:** `objective` field missing from API response

**Impact:** Project objectives won't be displayed in frontend

**Solution:** Add `objective` field to Django project model/serializer

### ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUE #2: Incomplete Frontend Integration**

**Problem:** Some frontend components not using normalized field names

**Impact:** Inconsistent data display, potential bugs

**Solution:** Update remaining components to use `ProjectData` interface consistently

---

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Normalization Layer Performance
- ✅ Minimal overhead (simple field mapping)
- ✅ No additional API calls required
- ✅ Efficient list processing
- ✅ Memory usage remains constant

### API Request Impact
- ✅ No additional requests for normalization
- ✅ Single response transformation
- ✅ Backwards compatible implementation

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **🚨 HIGH PRIORITY:** Fix Django API `member_count` field
   ```python
   # In Django project serializer
   class ProjectSerializer(ModelSerializer):
       member_count = SerializerMethodField()
       
       def get_member_count(self, obj):
           return obj.evaluators.count()
   ```

2. **📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Update frontend components
   - Update `PersonalServiceDashboard.tsx` to use normalized fields
   - Update `MyProjects.tsx` to display calculated fields
   - Standardize field usage across all admin components

3. **🔧 LOW PRIORITY:** Add validation layer
   - Add API response validation
   - Add TypeScript strict field checking
   - Add unit tests for normalization functions

### Long-term Improvements

1. **API Field Validation:** Implement automated tests to catch field mismatches
2. **Component Standardization:** Create shared interfaces and enforce usage
3. **Documentation:** Document all field mappings and calculated fields
4. **Error Handling:** Improve error handling for missing fields

## Conclusion

The data normalization layer successfully resolves the field mismatch issues between Django backend and frontend. The implementation:

- ✅ **Correctly handles field mapping** (deadline ↔ dueDate)
- ✅ **Properly normalizes status values** (evaluation → active)
- ✅ **Calculates derived fields** (completionRate, ownerEmail)
- ✅ **Preserves data integrity** through bidirectional conversion
- ✅ **Handles edge cases gracefully** with appropriate defaults

**However, the critical missing `member_count` field in the Django API response must be addressed immediately** to ensure accurate evaluator count and completion rate calculations.

Once the backend API is updated to include the missing fields, the data normalization layer will provide complete and accurate data transformation for the AHP platform frontend-backend integration.
